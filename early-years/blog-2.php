        							<p>Inquiry-based learning is an approach to learning that emphasizes the student’s role in the learning process. Rather than the teacher telling students what they need to know, students are encouraged to explore the material, ask questions, and share ideas.</p><br>
                                    
                                    <p>Inquiry-based learning uses different approaches to learning, including small-group discussion and guided learning. Instead of memorizing facts and material, students learn by doing. This allows them to build knowledge through exploration, experience, and discussion.</p><br>

                                    <span> We retain 75% of what we do- compared to 5% of what we hear and 10% of what we read!</span>

        							<p> Inquiry-based learning allows students to better understand and recall material by actively engaging with it and making their own connections.</p>

                                    <span>Children learn by being provided the environment for experiential learning </span>

        							<p>At The Vivekian’s Early Years we believe that children learn through active and direct experiences with their environment, which helps them to construct their knowledge with interaction and guidance from teachers and peers. Learning sustains when constructed.</p><br>

                                    <p> At early stage, children start exploring the next level of information and the spiral continues. It needs to be ensured that children are provided developmentally appropriate materials, experiences, and challenges in order to help them construct their own knowledge. The process also involves repetition of tasks, guidance from the teachers and more knowledgeable peers so that each child reaches her/his potential and is able to do the task, independently. Just like experiential learning, inquiry-based learning actively engages students in the learning process. Students aren’t just hearing or writing what they are learning. Instead, students get the chance to explore a topic more deeply and learn from their own first-hand experiences.</p><br>

                                    <p>At The Vivekian’s Early Years- we have curated a perfect amalgamation of the Inquiry-based learning and Experiential Learning to lay an impeccable foundation of learning and growth for our tiny tots. 
                                    The innovative mix of these pedagogies enables the students at The Vivekian’s Early Years to become better learners than their peers from other educational set ups.
