        							<p>Activities undertaken in school in the form of hobbies, dramatization, stage performances, special assemblies and other curricular activities, teach the important concept that for education to be most effective, education should be fun and not forced.</p><br>

        							<p>Educational games serve a good purpose in this direction. For example, stage play can be used for history and mother tongue. Mathematical games can be used to learn or practice various mathematical facts. We arrange competition between groups in the class or between different classes in the school and thus make the children interested in knowing so many things of general interest or related with some specific subjects.</p>

        							<p>In this way play can be used as an effective medium for imparting valuable education. Not only does it pave the way for imparting effective and enduring education; it helps in realizing the broader aims of education. It helps bring the harmonious development of the personality of children by taking care of their physical, mental, emotional, social and moral development. It also provides opportunities for the modification of their behaviour and prepares them for getting adjusted to their environment and life.</p>

        							<span> Thus at The Vivekianâ€™s Early Year play and the play way is regarded as an effective means of educating our children.</span>
