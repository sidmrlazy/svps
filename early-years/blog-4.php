        							<p>As an experienced educational institution run by experienced educationist for over a decade, we at Swami Vivekanand Public School have understand that when choosing a school, the first thing the parents hope to find is a school that shoulders their responsibility of making their children effective and efficient communicators and confident individuals with balanced sense of being- mentally, physically and spiritually. </p><br>
                                    
                                    <p>As we believe in ‘Starting from the Start’- The Vivekian’s Early Years has been established as an institution that has a dedicated goal of instilling and harnessing the skills of effective communication and social interactions in our students- right from the very beginning.</p><br>

                                    <!-- <span> We retain 75% of what we do- compared to 5% of what we hear and 10% of what we read!</span> -->

        							<p>We believe that Conversation is the very heart of schooling and pedagogy. In early education, oral language development is particularly significant for interactions, social relationships, and friendships, and for building a sense of belonging. Our educators help children develop oral language skills both directly through linguistic interaction with them and indirectly by creating an environment, which is rich in learning stimuli. Communication permeates all the learning domains of the curriculum, facilitating an interactive and multi-sensory learning process.</p>

                                    <!-- <span>Children learn by being provided the environment for experiential learning </span> -->

        							<p>Our Interactive teaching enhances learning experiences: Interaction (child-child, child-teacher, and child-material) is the most significant aspect of quality preschool education. The interaction between children, the range of environmental and cultural experiences along with meaningful dialogues helps children build a solid knowledge foundation and prepares them for formal schooling. </p><br>

                                    <!-- <p> At early stage, children start exploring the next level of information and the spiral continues. It needs to be ensured that children are provided developmentally appropriate materials, experiences, and challenges in order to help them construct their own knowledge. The process also involves repetition of tasks, guidance from the teachers and more knowledgeable peers so that each child reaches her/his potential and is able to do the task, independently. Just like experiential learning, inquiry-based learning actively engages students in the learning process. Students aren’t just hearing or writing what they are learning. Instead, students get the chance to explore a topic more deeply and learn from their own first-hand experiences.</p><br> -->

                                    <!-- <p>At The Vivekian’s Early Years- we have curated a perfect amalgamation of the Inquiry-based learning and Experiential Learning to lay an impeccable foundation of learning and growth for our tiny tots. 
                                    The innovative mix of these pedagogies enables the students at The Vivekian’s Early Years to become better learners than their peers from other educational set ups.
